Feature: Evaluate SpecFlow Feature File

  As a user
  I want to evaluate a SpecFlow feature file
  So that I can assess its quality and completeness

  Scenario: Generate evaluation score using GPT 4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
    Given I have a set of requirements
    And I have a SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation
    Then the application should generate an evaluation score
    And the evaluation should use GPT 4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet

  Scenario: Evaluation includes feature file and scenario evaluations
    Given I have requested an evaluation
    When the evaluation is generated
    Then the score should include a feature file evaluation
    And the score should include a scenario evaluation

  Scenario: Scenario evaluation assesses each individual scenario
    Given I have a SpecFlow feature file with multiple scenarios
    When the scenario evaluation is performed
    Then each scenario should be evaluated individually

  Scenario: Evaluation with empty requirements
    Given I have an empty set of requirements
    And I have a SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation
    Then the application should handle the empty requirements gracefully
    And provide an appropriate error message or result

  Scenario: Evaluation with empty SpecFlow feature file
    Given I have a set of requirements
    And I have an empty SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation
    Then the application should handle the empty feature file gracefully
    And provide an appropriate error message or result

  Scenario: Evaluation with invalid SpecFlow feature file format
    Given I have a set of requirements
    And I have an invalid SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation
    Then the application should detect the invalid format
    And provide an appropriate error message

  Scenario: Evaluation with mismatched requirements and feature file
    Given I have a set of requirements
    And I have a SpecFlow feature file that doesn't match the requirements
    When I request an evaluation
    Then the evaluation should highlight the mismatches
    And provide a lower score for incomplete coverage

# The following scenarios are recommendations:
# Scenario: Compare evaluation results between GPT 4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
#   Given I have generated evaluation scores using both models
#   When I compare the results
#   Then I should see a comparison of scores and insights from each model
#
# Scenario: Export evaluation results
#   Given I have generated an evaluation score
#   When I request to export the results
#   Then the application should provide the evaluation in a downloadable format
#
# Scenario: Batch evaluation of multiple SpecFlow feature files
#   Given I have multiple SpecFlow feature files
#   When I request a batch evaluation
#   Then the application should evaluate all files
#   And provide individual scores for each file
#   And an overall summary score
