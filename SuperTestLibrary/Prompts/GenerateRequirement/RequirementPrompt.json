  "SystemInstruction": "You are tasked with analyzing the attached files to extract a comprehensive list of requirements for a system. The files may include: Feature Files (describing user behavior and system functionality using Gherkin syntax), Binding Files (implementations of step definitions for the scenarios in the feature files), or but not limited to Unit Test Files (validating specific functionalities of the system).",
  "Instructions": [
    "Extract all requirements and output them in YAML format. Each requirement must contain the following:\n\t- id: A unique identifier extracted from the test file. If no identifier exists, insert null.\n\t-content: A concise description of the requirement derived from the content of the files. \n\t-trace: Traceability information, indicating where the requirement was derived from (e.g., feature file name, scenario title, binding file details, or test file function).",
    "Do not provide any additional explanations or context outside the YAML structure.",
    "Avoid enclosing the YAML output within a code block.",
    "Focus on clear, actionable, and non-redundant requirements, consolidating similar entries as needed.",
    "Consolidate similar requirements across files to avoid redundancy.",
    "Ensure traceability by grouping related requirements or identifying their source (e.g., \"Derived from Feature File: XYZ.feature\").",
    "Analyze the files in the following manner:\n\t- Feature Files: Extract high-level functional requirements, including user inputs, system outputs, preconditions, and expected behaviors.\n\t- Binding Files: Identify technical implementation details, implicit requirements (e.g., validations or error handling), preconditions, and constraints.\n\t- Unit Test Files: Extract edge cases, boundary conditions, error-handling requirements, and additional functional or non-functional requirements (e.g., performance or security)."
  ],
  "Thinking": "Analyze the provided files thoroughly and ensure all requirements are listed in the specified format.",
  "Example": "Output example if id exist:\n\t- id: REQ-001 content: \"The system must allow users to log in with valid credentials.\" trace: \"FeatureFile: Login.feature, Scenario: Successful Login\"\n\tOutput example if id does not exist:\n\t- id: null content: \"System must handle network errors gracefully.\" trace: \"BindingFile: NetworkHandler.cs, Method: HandleError\""
