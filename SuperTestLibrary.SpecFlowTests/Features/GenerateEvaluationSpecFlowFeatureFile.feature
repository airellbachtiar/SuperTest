Feature: Evaluate SpecFlow Feature File

  As a user of the application
  I want to generate an evaluation score for a SpecFlow feature file
  So that I can assess its quality based on given requirements

  Scenario: Generate evaluation score for a valid SpecFlow feature file
    Given I have a set of requirements
    And I have a valid SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation score
    Then the application should generate an evaluation score

  Scenario: Attempt to generate evaluation score without requirements
    Given I have a valid SpecFlow feature file
    But I don't have any requirements
    When I request an evaluation score
    Then the application should return an error
    And the error should indicate that requirements are missing

  Scenario: Attempt to generate evaluation score without a SpecFlow feature file
    Given I have a set of requirements
    But I don't have a SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation score
    Then the application should return an error
    And the error should indicate that a SpecFlow feature file is missing

  Scenario: Generate evaluation score with detailed feedback
    Given I have a set of requirements
    And I have a valid SpecFlow feature file
    When I request an evaluation score
